- Bootstraping a Multi-node cluster with `kubeadm` 
- We will expand our single-node setup into production-style, multi-node cluster 


+ **Prerequisite all nodes** 
You need to ensure that it's completed on every node: 
- Ensure unique hostnames, MAC addresses , and `product_uuids` 
- Disable swap memory 
- Configure required kernel modules and `sysctl` settings 
- Install a container runtime (`containerd`) with the `systemd cgroup` driver 
- Install `kubeadm,kubelet,kubectl` and place them on hold 
- If we are running this with VM, we have to enable it as bridge.
